Using the App:
  Should be realatively straightforward. Each part of the API has
  a separate menu item. The code for each section can be found in the
  relevant javascript files e.g. contacts.js

App Structure:
  As much as possible, the app follows the MVC application pattern.
  There is one major difference though, and that is the View code is
  server-side (/ext/server/private/). When the App initialises, it makes an AJAX
  call to get the View structure, which is then translated (with the help of 
  /script/view/parser.js) before being passed in the Sencha Framework. 
  This allows for tweaking of the View layout post deployment of the App.

  The application code, or business logic is in the controllers
  (/script/controller/). Each menu item has it's own controller, which the 
  View has callbacks to.

  There are a few Models used by the App (/script/model/) such as the 
  Contact model. These models are defined using the Sencha model registration
  method (Ext.regModel)

Third party resources:
  All third party resources are located in /resources/. The Sencha Touch library
  can be found in here.
